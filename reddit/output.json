The former kind is more traditional, but the latter sort is becoming increasingly common in China nowadays. So I figured that it might be nice to teach you both types of filling: gooey and custardy.

The gooey filling\u2019ll be both easier and more visually impressive.", "Video is here if you\u2019d like a visual to follow along", "The way I\u2019ll organize this is to first go over the custard-y filling, then the gooey filling, and finally how to make the Baozi wrappers/steam these.", "Ingredients, Custard-y filling:", "So what you\u2019ll find with Cantonese custard is a lot of the same ideas as Western custard, but translated for use in Guangdong. Perhaps most obviously, the custard that you get here is going to be way thicker than what you might be used to \u2013 this\u2019s going to end up almost a paste.", "Some of the ingredients are different too \u2013 likely harkening back to a time when it was much tougher to source cream/milk in Guangdong than it is now.

Put like 2-3lbs of bone-in, skin-on dark meat chicken in the pressure cooker with water up to the 10 cup line in the pot. Add a Tbs of salt, or less if you want to adjust the final version more. If you want to class it up a bit put some whole peppercorns, carrot, celery, onion in it. Hit the poultry button (like 15 minutes) and do something else for awhile. When its done remove the chicken with some tongs and put it in a container and let it cool. If you put vegetables in throw them away. Strain the liquid into a large container and let it cool for a bit. Put both the containers in the fridge overnight.", "Day 2: Hell ya that shit was easy. This aint hard either. Dice up a couple carrots, celery stalks, half an onion (may have to adjust if you have tiny onions, my store has mammoth ones), as much garlic as you want. Set aside. Remove the chicken and broth from the fridge. Remove the skin and bones from the meat and shred it and set aside. Skim the solidified fat off the top of the broth, if you put a metal spoon in the freezer for a few minutes first it makes it a bit easier. IDK why. Put a pot on the stove over medium heat, add olive oil, and saute the veggies (minus garlic) until they start to soften. Put in the garlic and a several generous grinds of pepper. Add whatever herbs you want - thyme is classic and i usually put in a bay leaf too. (a sneaky idea is to add a Parmesan rind) Add the broth and bring to a simmer for like 15 minutes. Add whatever type of noodle you want (fresh or frozen egg, dried). When the noodle is almost al dente add the shredded meat. Simmer for a few more minutes, salt and pepper to taste, and youre done. Eat it with lots of oyster crackers.", "Its nothing revolutionary but you get a really full flavored broth, tender meat, and not-overdone veggies for not very much effort.

It shorted itself out twice and now has moisture under the screen, i have treated it like i did my old RT-600 thermoworks that has worked for 6 years, and this thing won\u2019t last two months without required two week long vacations in rice. Also,  their customer support is useless. I was going to cave in and order a Thermpen and be done, but saw Thermopro released this as a knock off and ordered one. Thermopro makes a lot of decent smoker meat probes and such, with good reviews, so i figured it would be good. Then...Thermpen went on sale for $67 and I decided to go ahead and grab one of those too (Why not, right?). So here i am with three nice instant read thermometers. Maybe i can help someone make a decision. Since the Javelin and thermapen have been out for a while, i decided to focus a bit more on. the TP-19 since it was brand new, and there were plenty of other reviews for the Thermapen and Javelin.", "The TP-19 seems to be pretty well made, about on par with the Javelin Pro. It is not as high quality as the Thermapen, but it also costs a 1/4 as much. The TP-19 and Javelin pro feel lighter and the plastic feels a bit cheaper than the Thermapen. For example, the battery cover screws into plastic on the TP-19 where as the thermapen battery cover screws into a metal nut. The battery cover on the Javelin Pro just uses something like a quarter to turn it and does not inspire much confidence (once again, terrible waterproofing). AAA batteries (Yes!) in the Thermapen and TP-19 and 2032 coin battery in the javelin (gross). The TP-19 does look kind of cheap, but its a meat thermometer, so not sure how important it is.", "They all open up and close easily, and turns on and off as you do so. As for the speed differences between the three units, I can not really tell any difference. All three are very quick and all three seem to be about the same on accuracy (I\u2019m an amateur so they are plenty accurate for me). They are decently faster than my old Thermoworks RT-600. The displays are all pretty easy to read. Both the Thermapen and TP-19 use a thermocouple while the Javelin pro is a thermistor. The T-19 has a bright red LCD display, kind of like an old alrm clock. The other two use backlit LCD screens, with the Thermapen being automatic and the Javelin having to be turned on. The Javelin and TP-19 rotate 2 directions (up or down), while the Thermapen can rotate 4 directions. The accelerometer in the TP-19 is a bit more jumpy. As you move it around the screen cant always decide which direction it wants to face, which is not a big problem, but something annoying i noticed when testing it.  The Javelin and TP-19 have magnets built in which allow you to stick them to a fridge or other metalic areas, but the thermapen does not. Thermapen and TP-19 claim to be fully IP-67 waterproof, where as the Javelin is just water resistant (debatable). The Tp-19 and Thermapen feature some rubber on the back to keep the units from sliding, but nothing on the Javelin.", "If you want a fast handheld thermometer, i think the Thermo Pro TP-19 is a great option without spending a ton. If you you want to spend a bit more on the Thermapen for a better quality unit that has a great company behind it, its a great option too. Thermoworks is THE name in thermometers and are used in many professional kitchens around the world for a reason. Who knows how long each will last. People say buy it for life with the thermapen, and i have had my little cheap one from them that has worked perfectly for years, but who really knows. My only real advice is to skip the Lavatools Javelin Pro. At $50+ it offers up nothing to the table. Their customer service is useless and the unit has no waterproofingreally, which to me is important for a kitchen thermometer. It also seems to do nothing better than the TP-19 for double the cost."]},

Maybe you quite like it. You come to China and excitedly order the same dish, dig in, and\u2026 bones. Lots of little ones, tiny shards poking your gullet, and they seem\u2026 impossible to eat around. And while I\u2019ll usually wax poetic about how I think more Americans should be comfortable eating around bones (e.g. Chinese poultry dishes), this one\u2026 I totally get.", "Those little fish bones, literally translated, are referred to as \u201cfish daggers\u201d in Mandarin\u2026 and it can be a bit tough to work through. You have to eat at like a snails pace, patiently nibbling at the meat. Otherwise? It\u2019s crazy easy to get them stuck in your throat, to which the cure is gargling vinegar. They\u2019re often called \u201ctrash fish\u201d in America. So then, you might ask, why even go though the trouble of eating those sorts of fish?", "The answer\u2019s pretty straightforward \u2013 they taste good. Like, the flesh itself. Certain breeds of river fish are often prized as very \u2018umami\u2019 fish, and are deemed worth the effort. Where those happen to fall on your personal taste <-> effort continuums is ultimately up to you.", "Which brings me to lingyu \u2013 mud carp. Lingyu is a small, super boney river fish that\u2019re found in the Pearl and Mekong rivers. They are an extreme case of the above dynamic \u2013 super tasty fish, super boney. In Vietnam they crack that nut by eating the fish only when they\u2019re small (i.e. about fingerlings) so that they can be eaten whole. Smart, IIRC they make a hotpot with them. Cantonese cuisine, meanwhile\u2026 takes a different approach.", "Adult Lingyu are used, but\u2019re used in a whole host of different preparations \u2013 some of which feel like echo an almost deconstructionist view of cooking. The basic way to sort it\u2019s to mince it up \u2013 bones and all \u2013 and pound it into a paste, stuffing it into everything from chilis (what we\u2019ll show you today) to bitter gourd, to back into the skin the fish came in. Another awesome use of the paste is to make it a bit looser, mix it with egg white, and deep fry it \u2013 a preparation that\u2019s so reminiscent of tofu that it\u2019s literally called \u201cfish tofu\u201d. Or another way people sort it is to carefully get all of the flakes of meat off the little bones, and make it into a soup that\u2019s a deadpan for the consistency of congee.", "Now, I know you\u2019re not going to be able to source mud carp\u2026 I mean, unless you happen to live along the Pearl or Mekong rivers. Don\u2019t worry, I tested this with sea bass and tilapia too, it all works (with an adjustment or two).", "So why am I telling you all this? Because I feel like it a speaks to a bit of the essence of Cantonese food. Ask ten Cantonese chefs what Cantonese food\u2019s all about and at least nine will respond \u201cpreserving the original taste of the ingredient\u201d. And I guess maybe compared to, say, Sichuan food? But how much of the original taste of pork do you get in braised pork with Chuhou paste? Or soy sauce chicken? Cantonese food, to me, is about transformation \u2013 taking ingredients that some people may discard and doing awesome things with them. And while that philosophy can certainly be found in many cuisines\u2026 it just feels especially pronounced here.", "Anyway, enough rambling. Fish stuffed chilis. I\u2019ll show you how to make it the original way using Lingyu (just in case you happen to live in China or want to get creative with your own local boney fish), and also show you how to sort it with something you could actually buy from the supermarket.", "Video is here if you\u2019d like a visual to follow along"]},

I've always wanted to get a portable stove so I never have to worry about this again, but am wondering about safety concerns.  Most people are saying you shouldn't use them indoors as they can cause carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide buildup, but I know that chinese and especially japanese home kitchens very often primarily use portable stoves for their cooking. This cautionary claim doesn't make sense to me, as people have stationary gas stoves in their homes in the first place. If they're burning the same fuel as portable stoves (which I thought they very often are), aren't they just as dangerous as portable stoves? If anyone could provide a bit of insight that would be amazing. I'd be down to use a portable stove in my kitchen as long as I'm not on the razor's edge in terms of danger."]},

The first one of the beefsteak that has been growing perfectly. It\u2019s pretty ripe and I didn\u2019t plan on making burgers yet but wanted to use it so I decided to slice up a couple pieces and make a sandwich with roasted turkey, lettuce, and pepper jack cheese.", "Now I\u2019ve had sandwiches in the past with tomatoes and like I\u2019ve said, never really liked them. They have always just been watery and bland. A little acidic but that\u2019s it.", "I prepped my sandwich and decided to use my cast iron reversible griddle and grill press to heat it up and make some neat looking grill marks and melt the cheese.", "After it was all done it looked glorious so I opened up a bag of All Dressed chips (first time going to Canada and I brought back bags and bags of these) and decided to take a bite of the sandwich without any condiments to see how the tomato tasted.", "Oh my god. It was mind blowing. I seriously couldn\u2019t believe a tomato could taste like that. Like I was truly thinking \u201cnah that can\u2019t just be from the tomato\u201d so I went and grabbed the leftover tomato and sliced off another piece. Put it in my mouth and just started laughing. Like wtf have I been eating my whole life when I\u2019ve had tomatoes.", "I\u2019ve been thinking about that tomato all day today and am counting down the minutes until I get home so I can make a real BLT (going with Kenji\u2019s recipe)."]},

Has anyone done anything like, for example, replaced injera (the large sourdough flatbread) and used a giant tortilla instead and put Mexican food (mole chicken, chorizo, carnitas, simple salad, beans, rice, sweet salsas, spicy salsas, guacamole, ect...) on it? I can think the same can be used with Italian using a thin pizza crust with Italian toppings or Mediterranean with thin pita and Mediterranean toppings. Any help would be much appreciated.
